## Project Overview

Welcome to this project repository. we‚Äôll walk through an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, building a model to predict whether a technologist prefers working remotely or in person using stackoverflow‚Äôs developer survey of 2023.

## Data Source

we obtained data from <a href="https://cdn.stackoverflow.co/files/jo7n4k8s/production/49915bfd46d0902c3564fd9a06b509d08a20488c.zip/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2023.zip">StackOverflow 2023 Developer Survey</a> containing survey results of technologists, such as age, employment type, developer type, education level, years of coding experience, years of professional coding experience, organization size, country, and salary details.


## Technologies Used

In developing this end-to-end mahine learning project, the technologies used include:

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - Libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn
- **Tools & Platforms:** 
  - Git and GitHub for version control



```
1. **Fork the repository** and create your feature branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
   ```

2. **Commit your changes**:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your feature description"
   ```

3. **Push your branch** to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/YourFeature
   ```

4. **Open a pull request** to the `main` branch.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Using techniques like over-sampling or under-sampling to handle class imbalance.
- [ ] Include some additional features in the train dataset.
- [ ] Use different approach to handle missing data.
- [ ] Experimenting with some other models such as KNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning.
